# Machine-Learning-Deep-Learning-Frameworks
Jupyter notebooks implementing features of machine learning and neural networks. I learned much of this material and wrote much of this code while completing the Deep Learning specialization on Coursera.

## Logistic regression with a neural network mindset
LogisticRegressionFromScratch.ipynb:
- Step-by-step implementation of logistic regression, created in the style of a neural network.
- Contains functions that initialize variables, perform forward and backward propagation, optimize parameters using gradient descent, and make predictions on new data.
- Model is tested on sci-kit learn's breast cancer dataset.

## Neural network from scratch using TensorFlow
neural_network.py
- Defines class NeuralNetwork, which implements a neural network using TensorFlow.

NeuralNetworkDemo.ipynb
- Instantiates NeuralNetwork and applies to MNIST hand-written digit dataset.
- Defines functions to plot model performance and display images and classifications.
